    # ------------
    # Tests to run
    # ------------

    # NB: the tests to run are automatically deduced by the CI script according to the
    # content of the app's manifest. The declarations below allow to customize which
    # tests are ran, possibly add special test suite to test special args, or
    # declare which commits to test upgrade from.
    #
    # You can also decide (though this is discouraged!) to ban/ignore some tests,

    # exclude = ["install.private", "install.multi", "install.nourl", "backup_restore", "upgrade", "change_url"]


    # -------------------------------
    # Default args to use for install
    # -------------------------------

    # By default, the CI will automagically fill the 'standard' args
    # such as domain, path, admin, is_public and password with relevant values
    # and also install args with a "default" provided in the manifest..
    # It should only make sense to declare custom args here for args with no default values
